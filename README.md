## Introduction
Every year, breast cancer accounts for 30% of all cancer cases among women in the U.S., with a woman having a 13% lifetime risk of developing the disease (breastcancer.org, 2024).  With such high occurrence rates, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women (American Cancer Society, 2024). Similar to other types of cancer, the World Health Organization identifies early diagnosis as the most effective way to combat breast cancer (WHO, 2024). With these facts and statistics in mind, our project aims to analyze data on breast tumor characteristics to distinguish between cancerous and benign tumors while identifying the strongest predictors of breast cancer. After our exploratory data analysis,  we implement a random forest as a benchmark model, and improve on it with a support vector machine. 

The data for our project comes from the Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset from the University of Wisconsin Madison (hyperlink this). The dataset consists of 569 instances derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses. Each instance is classified as either benign or malignant, with 30 numeric features characterizing the cell nuclei, including measurements of radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and symmetry.
